        OLD TIME SAILORS LTD – THE TRUTH BEHIND THE BAND!
    </H1></P>
    <P>
       The purpose of this informational webpage is to ensure the <B>public and the venues that support and employ ‘The Old Time Sailors LTD’</B> are
        fully aware of the business practices employed by Mr Andres Nicolás Guzman and the core associates of this band.
    </P> 
    <HR>
    </html><p><B>Here is your band from 2024.</B> <BR><BR>We have noted those who weren’t paid for you. <p>The core members are;
        Mr Andres Guzman (aka Captain Nick), Patricio Manifesto Sarmiento, Ms Katie Richards, Brisa Vigna, Ignacio Camirroaga, Lazaro Infante and Josefina Duvieilh.</p>

            <p><br>This is the band members from last year (2024). For clarity, we have identified those who were <b>NOT</b> paid. <BR><BR>
Allegedly Mr Guzman informed the band of various reasons for not being paid, some excuses we know to be lies, but the main one being that the tour went really badly. 
We ask you wonderful fans that came to the shows last year, did they look like a flop, or did they look like sell-out shows? 
It's estimated that from the 228 shows in 180 days that this band performed, the prices of most gigs ranged from £1500-£6000. With the merchandise
 sales included the maths of this means Mr Guzman’s revenue would have been around £500k, yet was unable to pay these members for working every day, which when you add up travel time amounts to 90hrs plus of work a week. 
</p>
<p> How would the hard working people of the UK feel if you worked for 7 days a week for 6 months solid with virtually no breaks in between shows and at the end of all that hard work, Mr Guzman pays you nothing? In fact, it’s worse than that as all of these people that haven’t been paid have also funded to their own return flights from Argentina of around on average £1200 which was never reimbursed, plus the charge of extending their ticket for the full 6 months which ranged between £500-£1000. One could allege that this looks very much like <B>modern day slavery!</B></p>
<p>
    <B>PLEASE TAKE THE TIME TO READ THIS WEBPAGE AND MAKE YOUR OWN MIND UP.</B>
</p>
    <p><i>The vast majority of these band members are of Argentinian nationality and therefore have no voice in this country with regards to any legal action that they may wish to take against Mr Guzman.</i><BR></p>
        <H3> Who are we you may ask?</H3>
        <P>
        We are a collective that have come together to help the victims who currently have no voice after the abuse they endured under the rule of Mr Guzman and those who enable him.<BR><BR>
        Our reason for doing this is because you, <b>the public, and more importantly the fans as well as the venues employing</b> the band, deserve to know the truth of how those that you have supported and bought tickets, were and are being treated and where your money goes or more specifically, where it doesn’t go.

         <h3>YOU MAY ASK WHAT SPECIFICALLY ARE THE ALLEGATIONS OF THIS GROUP THAT HAVEN’T BEEN PAID? LET US EXPLAIN;</h3>
        <style>ol {padding-left: 80px;padding-right: 60px;}</style>
       <ol><li>Nearly all of members identified in the photograph above have <b>NOT been paid anything at all</b> or a very small amount for any of their work in the "Old Time Sailors Band ltd" in 2024. The band members of the 2023, 2022 and 2021 tours did get paid, but the majority never received their full payment, the reason given was for alleged misdemeanours.
            <br><br><li>Mr Guzman employs almost cult like methods to ensure no one leaves the band and that he has ultimate control over them whilst under his care. This includes not being allowed to leave the bands base in the Devon farm where they sleep to ensure there is no unwanted interaction with anyone. The only exception was when travelling to and from venues.
            <br><br><li>It’s alleged that he states that any of the band members can leave when ever they wish to. That’s possiby true but ask yourselves how any member (other than the core members) can do that when they have no money? How can they change their flights, get transport to the airports or pay for any required accommodation? <b>Please read the plight of 3 members of the band below.</b>
            <br><br><li>He uses the core members to video and listen to any voices of discontent which is then reported back to him so that he can punish those who dare to question his methods. 
            <br><br><li>Mr Guzman provides the members of the band with monopoly style money tokens. If you break any of his ‘rules’ you are fined and expected to pay him in real money if you go into negative figures. If you’ve been a good person and reported alleged misdemeanours, you may be granted more tokens which you can use to purchase refreshments…..from Mr Guzman of course.
            <br><br><li>Mr Guzman is more than happy to abandon members of this band at a motorway service station or a train station without any of their personal possessions or without any money. They were just left to their own devices. The core members of this group are apparently happy to go along with this or at least never made any protests against it happening. <b>Details are provided below.</b>
            <br><br><li>Members of the band are told to say that they are not working here but just on vacation and doing the tour for the experience. Would you work 7 days a week for 6 months just for the experience whilst Mr Guzman acting as the band agent is taking what might be considered a large sum of money for himself? Or is it possibly because the band are not here on working visas and their want to perform has been taken advantage of?
            <br><br><li>Some band members who are also employed to drive the vehicles between gigs are having their lives (and other road users) put at risk by working far too many hours and should never be driving where their working day has been far in excess of 8 hrs and sleep consisting of at worst 2 to 3 hours. <b>See pictures below.</b>
            <br><br><li> The OTS tours have been gaining more attraction. Last year they performed 228 shows in 180 days with ticket prices averaging roughly £20-£30. <B>Just read that again….228 almost consecutive shows in 180 days!</B> Would this give you cause you concern for their welfare? 
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>

</p>
<h3>
    How is this tour of the UK financially viable as a commercial enterprise?
</h3>
<p>
Let’s take some simplistic figures as we obviously don’t have the accounts of the band. Let’s assume that all of the band members were earning the UK national minimum wage of £11.44 per hour. (Note: <i>all figures are an approximation</i>)
</p>
<p>
There are 20 band members (not including Mr Guzman), 3 sound engineers, 2 photographers, 3 mechanics, and one cook. Let's take a very conservative estimate that they worked on average with travel time between events say 8hrs a day for 177 days (they had 3 days off in 180 days).
</p>
<p>
    29(band members) x £11.44(per hour) x 8(hrs) x 177(days). This would equate to <b>£469,772</b> as a minimum wage bill. The reality of the hours these individuals work is clearly against UK employment laws.
</p>
<p>
    Of course, Mr Guzman has expenses to pay out i.e. 2 x van hire for 6 months, road tax, insurance and MOT’s for his American Winnebago motorhome, Porsche Boxter, BMW Z3 sportster, touring van, removal van, American Damon Daybreak motorhome and canteen / mobile bedroom lorry. Fuel costs for each vehicle. Cost of 3 mobile homes to house the 25 band members plus the rent of the farm space and food costs.
</p>
<p>
    2 x (hire vans) x 180(days) x £100(day-estimate). <b>£36,000</b>
5 x (3 people transporters and 2 equipment vans) x 6000 miles(over 6 months) / 25miles per gallon x £4.60 per litre x 4.55(convert to gallon). <b>£25,116 </b>
</p>
<p>
    Just the basics <b>without</b> including very basic food, vehicle insurance, health insurance, visa permits, accommodation costs (static caravans on a farm) the costs of the band would be around close to <b>£500,000</b>
</p>
<p>
    The band completed 228 shows last year. Let’s assume an average receipt of £1000 per show. A few will be more than this but many small venues such as local pubs are not going to pay £1000 per show so this is probably a very optimistic revenue stream. There is also merchandise to take into account so let’s say they make an average of £200 on merchandise sales at each event. Again, probably very optimistic.
</p>
<p>
    228(shows) x avg £1000 per gig + £200 x 280 (possible merchandise sales per show). <b>£284,000</b>. So, if Mr Guzman paid <b>ALL</b> of the band members as in the example above, together with his outgoings and income, there would clearly not be enough income to make the band a viable commercial business. This is not taking into account flight costs to and from Argentina, rehearsal venue rent and Argentinian accommodation for some band members, VAT, National Insurance, Income Tax for himself or each band member.
</p>
<p>
    Now it becomes much clearer why Mr Guzman isn’t paying the majority of the band, and using Argentinian musicians to avoid cooberating with UK law. However our next worry is that he has employed and exploited UK citizens in his band and wants more to join, but doesn't seem to be making any changes to comply to UK employment law. He is exploting Argentinian workers who have no voice over here. How do you feel about him exploiting UK workers? Especially when the 2 that have worked for him in the past was a male who was a minor at the time, and a young female adult.

            <h4>Information regarding Item 5 above.</h4>
            <P>
                These are pictures of the Monopoly style money tokens that Mr Guzman used during the 2024 tour. These were used as a controlling method for members of the band to gain favour with Mr Guzman.
                The band was split in to Red, Blue, Green and Yellow houses (Harry Potter Style) so that they could compete against each other. 
            </P>
            <div class="left" >
                <IMG src="images/GreenGroup.jpg" width="220" height="170" >  <IMG src="images/BlueGroup.jpg" style="padding-left: 20px;"width="220" height="170"> <IMG src="images/RedGroup.JPG" style="padding-left: 20px;"width="220" height="170"> <IMG src="images/YellowGroup.JPG" style="padding-left: 20px; "width="220" height="170">
               </p>
<p>
    A few months into the tour Mr Guzman initiated a points system, with ‘distinctions’. These were fake printed money with a cartoon of the captain's face and the words ‘Old Time Sailors’ and ‘In Poseidon We Trust’ printed on them, along with Mr Guzman’s character signature. The band was split into 4 teams, and the premise of this was the team with the most points at the end of the tour would receive a prize. You would earn positive points for doing good, and negative points for doing bad. The distinctions earn could be used to buy the drinks (beer, cider or Coca Cola) that the venues would give to the band members for free. 
    They were no longer allowed to consume these at the gigs but would have to wait until they returned back to the base to ask to ‘buy’ them, if they had enough points. The distinctions could also be used to buy things such as large bottles of coca-cola, £1 mini pizzas, and more depending depending on how many points you had.  
</p>
<p>
    Now you would think they would earn points for efforts such as doing well on stage, selling a lot of merch, doing something kind for another band member. Alas no, points barely ever got given out for such things. Points would be awarded to the band member who took a photo or video of another member having done things such as not having cleaned up properly or not having turned up to the van in time. 
    One time this was the case as 1 member was carrying drinks for the band from the changing area to the van and they had fallen, so another member came over to help him resulting in them being 1 minute late. Despite this the pair of them still received negative points whilst the member who took the video showing they weren’t there was awarded the positive points. There was also the issue that those Mr Guzman favoured (coincidently mainly the core group) would receive the most positive points whilst those he took issue with received most negative points. Allegedly and according to what we have seen, the most points would be received if someone told Mr Guzman that another band member was speaking badly about the band or most importantly, him.

    <h4>Information regarding item 6 above.</h4>
<p>
    Next is the matter of those who left before the tour finished. 
</p>
<p>On the 21st July at the XChurch Music Festival, the first member to leave was one of the photographers. He had been informed by Mr Guzman a couple of months into the tour that he would not be getting paid for his work as initially agreed as Mr Guzman was allegedly unsatisfied with his work, despite the fact he had seen the quality of the photographers work and he had been working like the others non-stop every day. From this moment the photographer received grief from certain core members, causing him a great deal of stress and anxiety.<br><br>The day he decided to leave he had secretly packed his bags in the middle of the night and hid them in the back of the van that he travelled in. Once arriving at the festival that the band were playing at, he informed some of the core members that he would be leaving and that he had his bags with him. These core members proceeded to take him to one side to talk to him and try and persuade him to return to the base to talk to Mr Guzman, which he didn’t want to do because of the trauma he had already endured, he just wanted to leave. Whilst this was happening the other core members took his belongings and locked them in the van they travelled in. They refused to return his belongings to him, which included his passport, until he had copied all video and photo content over to them and wiped it from his computer.<br><br>This was on the orders of Mr Guzman. Mr Guzman’s argument was the photos belonged to him as the photographer had signed a contract. Once again this is a contract that he wouldn’t have received a copy of, and he never actually signed anything. However, using threats of suing and imprisonment the photographer ended up not calling the UK police which is what he wanted to do and agreed reluctantly to hand over his footage. He was then allowed to leave where he struggled to keep himself safe until his flight home. He has lost all his life savings, and is psychologically affected from the abuse he received. None of the band members were allowed to reach out to him to check if he was okay, because those who leave are shunned and it is prohibited to speak to them. The fear of getting caught was too much for them to risk it. </p>
    <hr><p><BR><BR>
        On the 12th August 2024, upon returning to the Devon base from DevaFest in Cholmondeley  Castle in Cheshire, the second member of the band, Emanuel Vazquez was dropped at Bristol Welcome Break services at approximately 3am in the middle of the night with no money or personal possessions. It’s alleged this was on the orders of Mr Guzman. His crime? He said something derogatory in jest about Mr Guzman in the van which was secretly being recorded by one of the band members and reported to Mr Guzman. Why was this private conversation secterely recorded? Because of the points system that had been put in place.
    </p>
    <hr><p><BR>
        On 12th August 2024, after arriving back at the Devon base at 7am from Devafest, the third member of the band, Franco Galante was asked to leave the band and travel in the van with some of the core members where he was dropped off at a motorway service station and left there for several hours, again without any money until someone returned and then took him to Exeter Train Station. He was abandoned here without any money or means to travel or pay for accommodation all with the full knowledge of Mr Guzman and the other core members of this band! His crime....he had sniggered at Mr Vazquez's comment whilst they were in the van together the previous day.
        <BR><BR><BR>
            <hr>
            <p>
                On 13th August 2024, the only British band member, Amy Harrison, left the band. The actions of what Mr Guzman had done being the final straw. She had been in great distress with how these band members had been treated, along with the mistreatment she had endured over the months, and didn't want to be a part of the band any longer. As the band members were prohibited from contacting or helping these 2 band members who had been kicked out and left she was in a highly stressful situation, as she was aware they had no where to go, no money and knew no one who could help house them. Though it went against the rules she contacted friends and family secretly to coordinate somewhere safe for the both of them, which caused further stress that was visible to the core members which worried them, as god forbid the venue audiences might have seen her distress. Her punishment for being visibly upset and having a panic attack? Getting shouted at and filmed by Ms Katie Richards. She was able to leave and get back to family but is still suffering with PTSD from the treatment she received from Mr Guzman and Ms Richards.

<h4>Information regarding item 8 above.</h4>
<p>
    These very disturbing pictures below were taken after an accident on the 24th August whilst travelling to a Gullworthy Parish Councillors Farm (George Lister) where they were due to perform. The driver was enroute to the farm along the lane towards Morwellham Quay having had only a few hours sleep. None of the occupants of the van at the time of the accident were taken to hospital to be checked for injuries. Each year since  2021 those who drive the vans have reported that they have fallen asleep at the wheel at some point due to lack of sleep. Mr Guzman is aware of this but is still willing to make his workers drive in these conditions and put them and the general public in danger if it means they get their gigs every day.

        Musicians and members of Old Time Sailors have an obligation to defend ourselves publicly against the scams that certain people have been circulating on the networks. We are being victims of a group of people who, acting as an illicit association, are doing everything possible to ruin this project where many musicians are involved. <p>They are using the tool of scratching impunished and unfairly, without presenting any evidence. Many musicians have gone through our project, and as with any large project there is always someone who is dissatisfied and causing problems. But even so most have become conform, having lived a unique experience. We are currently being victimized by a minority, which ironically calls itself the “majority”.
    </p>
        <p> We have resorted to justice, as we have ample evidence in our favor, including signed documents, and fortunately we are moving forward on that front as it should be. They have not gone to justice because they have no evidence in their favor, then instead they abuse the scrap as a social tool to damage our project and our image. Today we want to tell you who these people are so that they are aware and help us spread this message. These people we are going to mention have made countless efforts to destroy us, among these actions we can list:</p>
         <ol> <li> call all our clients to cancel our dates, 
            <li> send us to the police 10 times during our Europe tour with fabricated reports of drugs, guns, slaves and abuse to try to get us deported (they failed because there's nothing like that), 
                <li> communicate with all our musicians and people who were considering joining our project to convince them to get down, they managed to get down many musicians during our tour, including the lead singer, causing damage economics of all kinds,
                    <li> created fake instagram accounts of our project to defame us, 
                        <li> created and circulated flyers on social networks and whatsapp saying we are a scam, and many people who don't even know us shared them unscrupulously. Of course they never present evidence, because if they had it they would make a trial as appropriate. But since their plan is to destroy, for personal reasons, what they do is this: try to get the world to cancel our project. 
    
                        </li></ol>

    We ask you to please circulate this and in case of any doubt, consult us. We have plenty of evidence and we're here to show up, because we have nothing to be ashamed of. On the contrary, we're proud of our project and how far we've come. We are convinced that the biggest motivators behind the intentions of these people are envy, greed, jealousy, and pettiness. We can prove all this case by case, story by story, individual by individual, with extensive evidence, chats, audios, calls, signed documents, and testimonies from many witnesses. <p>
        They say they have "many" witnesses, but if you ask them, it turns out that they are people repeating what they heard from someone else. They are not real witnesses. Just people repeating because they “believe their friend”. Please help us fight this injustice, help that there are no people like this, who abuse a resource that real victims of abuse need to defend themselves. We are:

    Almost certainly they will state that these are all lies and certain members of the band are out to destroy The Old Time Sailors! They will say THEY are the victims of injustice! 
</p>
<p>
    Lets put this in to context. There are 4 court cases in Argentina against Mr Guzman for non payment of wages. These are from 3 band members of 2021 and 1 band member of the 2022 tour. The files for this can be found on this website  <a href="https://scw.pjn.gov.ar/scw">Argentinian Court Cases></a> 
    CNT 034854/2023 – CNT 034855/2023 – CNT 015466/2024 – CNT 015478/2024. Ask yourselves why these individuals would go to court if they had been PAID? 6 band members from 2024 have started procedures to sue Mr Guzman for the same reason, with more in the process of following suit. 
    <p>
        There is an ongoing Police investigation in to the activities of Mr Guzman in the UK. It is believed that all of the members of the (2025) band are here on vacation visas. Mr Guzman will more than likely state that the members are not being paid but are here for the experience. Would you work 7 days a week solidly for 6 months if you were not going to be paid for it!
        He will probably also state that this collective is trying to destroy the OTS band. Why would anyone want to do that? Those who have been affected are mostly Agentinian nationals who would have no ability to create another band in the UK that would be in competition with Mr Guzman's band.
    </p>
    <P>
        We challenge all those fans attending the events to ask the band members how much they are being paid and whether they have working visas? We'd love to know what they tell you! If you have been affected by Mr Guzman as a business or individual we would encourage you to contact authorities and join the growing group of support.
